 * Stripe Capital
 *
 * Stripe Capital lends our merchants funds in order to grow their businesses.
 * In exchange for these funds, instead of a traditional interest over time model, Stripe charges a fixed loan fee on top of the original loan amount.
 * To get back the investment, some percentage of the merchant's future sales goes towards repayment, until the total owed amount is repaid.
 *
 * In this problem, you'll be building a bookkeeping system for a modified version of Stripe Capital.
 * This bookkeeping system will have 4 API methods:
 *    1. A merchant can create a loan.
 *    2. A merchant can pay down a loan manually.
 *    3. A merchant can process transactions, from which some percentage of the processed amount goes towards repayment towards a loan.
 *    4. A merchant can increase an existing loan's amount.
 *
 * Your Task
 * 1. Evaluate each line of stdin, performing the actions as described by documentation below.
 *    - Each line will always begin with an API method, followed by a colon and a space, then followed by comma separated parameters for the API method, in order of the documentation.
 * 2. After evaluating all actions, print out a list of $merchant_id, $outstanding_debt pairs, skipping over merchants who do not have an outstanding balance. This list should be lexicographically sorted by the merchant ID.
 *
 * Keep in mind:
 *    - We will not test you against unparsable input formats. Handle them as you see fit.
 *    - We will evaluate both code correctness and code quality.
 *    - You are allowed to refer the web to make sure of various resources, tools, and documentation. However, do not copy code verbatim.
 *
 * API Documentation
 *
 * CREATE_LOAN: Merchant initiates a loan.
 * Fields
 *    - merchant_id: The ID of the merchant. (String; non-empty)
 *    - loan_id: The ID of the merchant's loan. (String; non-empty)
 *    - amount: The initial loan amount. (Integer; x >= 0)
 * Ex: CREATE_LOAN: merchant1, loan1, 1000
 *
 * PAY_LOAN: Merchants pays off their loans on a one-time basis.
 * Fields
 *    - merchant_id: The ID of the merchant. (String; non-empty)
 *    - loan_id: The ID of loan to pay off. (String; non-empty)
 *    - amount: The amount given back to Stripe. (Integer; x >= 0)
 * Ex: PAY_LOAN: merchant1, loan1, 1000
 *
 * INCREASE_LOAN: Merchant increases an existing loan.
 * Fields
 *    - merchant_id: The ID of the merchant. (String; non-empty)
 *    - loan_id: The ID of loan to increase. (String; non-empty)
 *    - amount: The amount to increase the loan by. (Integer; x >= 0)
 * Ex: PAY_LOAN: merchant1, loan1, 1000
 *
 * TRANSACTION_PROCESSED: A single transaction. A portion of the transaction amount is withheld to pay down the merchant's outstanding loans.
 * Fields
 *    - merchant_id: The ID of the merchant. (String; non-empty)
 *    - loan_id: The ID of loan to pay off for this transaction. (String; non-empty)
 *    - amount: The amount this transaction processed. (Integer; x >= 0)
 *    - repayment_percentage: The percentage of the transaction amount that goes towards repayment. (Integer; 1 <= x <= 100)
 * Ex: TRANSACTION_PROCESSED: merchant1, loan1, 500, 10
 *
 * System Behavior
 *    - This version of Capital will represent all monetary amounts as U.S. cents in integers (e.g. amount = 1000 => $10.00 USD)
 *    - A merchant may have multiple outstanding loans.
 *    - Loan IDs are unique to a given merchant only.
 *    - A loan's outstanding balance should never go negative. Ignore the remaining amount in the case of overpayment.
 *    - Truncate repayments when applicable (e.g. if withholding from a transaction is 433.64 cents, truncate to 433 cents).
 *    - Your system should handle invalid API actions appropriately. (ex: attempting to pay-off a nonexistent loan)
 *
 * Examples
 *
 * Example 0 (manual repayment):
 *    CREATE_LOAN: acct_foobar,loan1,5000
 *    PAY_LOAN: acct_foobar,loan,1000
 * Expected Output:
 *    acct_foobar,4000
 * Explanation:
 *    1. The merchant acct_foobar creates a loan ("loan1") for $50.00.
 *    2. The merchant pays down $10.00 of the loan.
 *    Result: The merchant owes Stripe $40.00.
 *
 * Example 1 (transaction repayment):
 *    CREATE_LOAN: acct_foobar,loan1,5000
 *    CREATE_LOAN: acct_foobar,loan2,5000
 *    TRANSACTION_PROCESSED: acct_foobar,loan1,500,10
 *    TRANSACTION_PROCESSED: acct_foobar,loan2,500,1
 * Expected Output:
 *    acct_foobar,9945
 *
 * Example 2 (multiple actions):
 *    CREATE_LOAN: acct_foobar,loan1,1000
 *    CREATE_LOAN: acct_foobar,loan2,2000
 *    CREATE_LOAN: acct_barfoo,loan1,3000
 *    TRANSACTION_PROCESSED: acct_foobar,loan1,100,1
 *    PAY_LOAN: acct_barfoo,loan1,1000
 *    INCREASE_LOAN: acct_foobar,loan2,1000
 * Expected Output:
 *    acct_barfoo,2000
 *    acct_foobar,3999
 * Explanation:
 *    1. The merchant acct_foobar creates two loans for $30.00 in total.
 *    2. The merchant acct_barfoo creates a loan for $30.00.
 *    3. Merchant acct_foobar processes a transaction, paying off $0.01 from loan1.
 *    4. Merchant acct_barfoo manually pays back a loan for $10.00.
 *    5. Merchant acct_foobar increases its second loan by $10.00.
 *    Result: acct_barfoo owes $20.00, acct_foobar owes $39.99.
