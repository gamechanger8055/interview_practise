Design an API using Django Rest Framework to retrieve weather information based on a user's location.
The API should provide the following functionalities:




Weather Retrieval:

Create an endpoint that accepts latitude and longitude as input parameters.
Upon receiving these coordinates, the API should fetch the current weather information
(e.g., temperature, humidity, weather description) for that location using a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap,
 WeatherAPI, etc.).

Authentication: Implement a simple API key-based authentication system for accessing the weather
information endpoint. Provide a default API key for demonstration purposes.

Response Format: Return the weather information in JSON format with appropriate fields for temperature,
 humidity, weather description, and any other relevant data.

Error Handling: Handle potential errors, such as invalid coordinates or authentication failures,
 by providing meaningful error messages in the API response.
